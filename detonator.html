    Main Bullet Strength: 600% BTE
	<br>
    Bullet Speed: 50% BTE
	<br>
    Shrapnel Speed: 75% BTE
	<br>
	<br>
	Recoil Per Cycle: 1500% BTE

	<strong>2. Tank Details</strong>
	<br>
The Detonator is a destroyer class with a special ability. The bullet shares all stats with destroyer as mentioned earlier except for one characteristic: When the main bullet takes damage, it will spit smaller bullets off of it totalling 50% of the damage taken to itself while the main bullet shrinks in size depending on how much damage it took.
	<br>
The shrapnel function operates like this:
		<br>
		<br>
The base bullet does 600% BTE, which is equal to a Destroyer's. Let's say the bullet took an impact where 150% of it's health was diminished i.e. from killing a player. A bunch of pieces of shrapnel will be ejected totalling 75% of the damage taken to the main bullet, or just under one basic tank bullet. A detonator bullet can produce a maximum of 24 pieces of shrapnel before it dies so this impact would result in 6 pieces of shrapnel being released, doing 12.5% basic tank damage each, whereas the bullet would shrink in size by 25%. The shrapnel damage might get buffed if 12.5% basic damage ends up being insufficient.
	<br>
	<br>
Depending on impact shrapnel can behave in multiple ways; a direct center impact produces an evenly spread could of shrapnel around the bullet as it flies away from the impact point; a slightly off center hit results in the shrapnel being ejected more to that side.
