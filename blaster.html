	<strong>2. Tank Details</strong>
	<br>
	The Blaster is a tank with extreme efficiency when attacking at close range, but that damage descreases at further range, and cannot hit enemies off screen. It shoots 4 bullets, 3 normal Basic Tank size bullets, and 1 small auto cannon size bullet. They fire as a stacked bunch, and spread out the further they travel. They fade at the edge of your FoV, and never exit yor FoV alive. At point blank range, it is deadly and can take out a Spike in two hits, and a normal rammer in one. The more the bullets spread out, the less effective they are, as they are no longer in a bunch. The Blaster is especially weak to snipers, as it cannot get close to them if they run away, and it cannot hit them if they are off screen.

	<br>
	A glassy build that has enough reload to be deadly to rammers, and a balance of speed for everything. Especially vulnerable to snipers, but rammers are easy food, especially ram Annihilators or Boosters.

	<br>
	A good rammer bait build, good for surviving a few hits and bating rammers and other tanks. Easily kills stupid rammers and allows for quick escape when under attack. Can block bullet spammers easily and fight back.
