		<strong>2. Tank Details</strong>
		<br>
		The Tracker has the same power as Hunter, but unlike the Hunter, it is able to see boss arrows, and with a click of a player on the leaderboard, it can get the leader arrow to switch to that player, with the arrow's name as the player's place on the leaderboard. By using this ability, it can easily hunt bosses, seek players, and eliminate them. However, unlike Predator, it cannot scope, making it more difficult to fight bosses. Stacking bullets is the most viable option, as it is much quicker with two bullets, and allows for high damage concentration.
